Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset
=================================================

Welcome to your first (required) programming assignment! 
You will build a logistic regression classifier to recognize  cats. 
This assignment will step you through how to do this with a Neural Network mindset, and so will also hone your intuitions about deep learning.

**Instructions:**
   - Do not use loops (for/while) in your code, unless the instructions explicitly ask you to do so.
   
**You will learn to:**
   - Build the general architecture of a learning algorithm, including:
        - Initializing parameters
        - Calculating the cost function and its gradient
        - Using an optimization algorithm (gradient descent)
        
   - Gather all three functions above into a main model function, in the right order.

1 - Packages
************

First, import all the packages that you will need during this assignment.
   - [numpy](www.numpy.org) is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
   - [h5py](http://www.h5py.org) is a common package to interact with a dataset that is stored on an H5 file.
   - [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) is a famous library to plot graphs in Python
   - [PIL](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) 
   - [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) are used here to test your model with your own picture at the end.
